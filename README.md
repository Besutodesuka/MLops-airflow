Q1: Why are there missing data in the profession?
Ans: because students are not graduated and do not obtain a profession.
 	34 Students have a profession. We think they might misunderstand that they should put their major in there. And with the small amount of data compared to the majority of the group, we think this data should be ignored.
To address this, we decided to fill the null in the profession column with “Student” as profession, then erase “Working Professional or Student”


Q2: Why are there missing data in many columns with similar volume such as work pressure, academic pressure, CGPA, study satisfaction, and job satisfaction?
Ans: 
	because there are columns specifically for student and employed like CGPA, study, satisfaction, etc.
Students will have null values in profession because they have not worked yet, and work pressure will also be null. If they are company employees, they will have null values in academic pressure and CGPA. Job satisfaction and study satisfaction show how much they are satisfied with their work and studies.
	To address this, We filled missing values as follows:
Profession: If  Working Professional or Student is 'Student', we set Profession to 'Student'. Otherwise, we filled NaN values in Profession with 'Unemployed'.
Pressure Level: We merged Academic Pressure (for students) and Work Pressure (for professionals) into a new column called pressure.
Satisfaction: We combined Study Satisfaction (for students) and Job Satisfaction (for employees) into a single column called Satisfaction.
CGPA: Since CGPA is only relevant for students, we filled missing values with -1 to indicate "Not Applicable" for working professionals.
